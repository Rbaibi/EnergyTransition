# Energy Transition

Mothership Coder Mission 2: [Living Environment Challenges](https://www.space4good.com/coder-missions/)

## Problem Definition
There is lack of information of the performance and return of investment (ROI) of different renewable energy sources located in different areas. 

## Example research questions
- There are several energy alternatives for [greenhouses in PZH](https://www.zuid-holland.nl/onderwerpen/energie/glastuinbouw/) that suggest the production of CO2 neutral corps (using geothermal energy, or residual heat from industries) but also (giving off energy from biomass). Can you design a plan that combines different energy sources to power greenhouses along with the surrounding neighborhoods and industries?

- Aquathermie energy from water, is being [suggested](https://www.zuid-holland.nl/actueel/nieuws/mei-2019/huizen-verwarmen/) as a potential energy source of the future. This involves creating heat energy networks thus aiming at industrial symbiosis. What is a feasible plan to deliver to policymakers in this regard? Can it involve local energy communities?

#### Others
- What combinations of energy sources and locations have the highest efficiency and Return on Investment from but not limiting to:
     - Wind turbines in land + at sea
     - Solar Panels in cities + farmland
     - Geothermal
     - Long term energy storage with water
- What energy type (wind, solar, geo) is best paired to serve what industry?
- How can you achieve the best efficiency by combining different sources for different uses (cooking, heating, lighting)?

## Deliverables
The participating team is asked to conduct the necessary research and build a prototype of a system able to:
- Investigate the suggested research questions and any additional relevant ones
- Find patterns in the historical and real-time data
- Simulate different future scenarios (trade-off analysis) 
- Calculate the financial projections of the various simulated scenarios for the local government
- Deliver a report on the findings and opportunity maps based on the results

## Stakeholders
- Households
- Local and national government
- Utility providers
- Producers of renewable energy facilities

## Available data
Coming soon
